                <h2>Why Choose At-Home Tests?</h2>
                
                <p>At-home health tests offer many advantages over traditional lab tests:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Privacy</strong>: Perform tests in the privacy of your home, especially appreciated for sensitive tests like STDs.</li>
                    <li><strong>Convenience</strong>: No need to schedule appointments or travel.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cost Savings</strong>: Often cheaper than lab tests, especially for those without comprehensive health insurance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Speed</strong>: Results are usually available within a few days.</li>
                    <li><strong>Tracking</strong>: Ability to monitor certain health markers over time.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>While these tests do not replace a full medical consultation, they are an excellent screening and monitoring tool for many conditions.</p>
